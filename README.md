# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Here are some facts about me

## I have a website

## I choose Javascript as my Scripting Language of Choice

The first programming languages I learned formally were Java and C++. When I started using Javascript back in 2016, I hated it for all the reasons you hear about: the use of `var`, prototypical inheritance, the lack of typing, how it tries to keep running where other languages would abort, the strange event loop, and callbacks, among other things. But after diving deeper to write sorting algorithms for fun, I began to love it â€” especially the recent changes in ES6. 

I don't know that there are many languages that care as much about continuing to improve the quality of life for developers as ECMAScript does. If something is annoying to write, there's probably syntatic sugar for it, or it's on the way, like top-level `await` and `Array.prototype.at()`, which allows you to index from the end of an array with negative numbers (as appears in other languages), which were added in ECMAScript 2022! The language is a great success story, in my book, especially considering where it started.

Python and Ruby are both neat, and I enjoy using them. I feel that, with Python, you can feel the C underneath, and with Ruby, it's nice to use a language that seemed to ask "how should this be?" from a blank slate.

## I find TypeScript to be amazing
when it works, of course.

## I have strong technical writing skills

[Here are some examples of my technical communication in a professional setting.](./technical-communication/README.md)

## I have used a number of technologies
