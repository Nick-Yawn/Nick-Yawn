# on a very curious bug in a React / Flask application
This is an interesting one. I was mistaken about `@login_required` setting the value of `current_user`, for one thing. This issue ended up being caused by a trailing `/` in the front-end `fetch` call. I spent several hours on this, and the fix was eventually suggested by the instructor of the python module. This was one of those brutal, brutal bugs.

# On async hashing:
While being mindful that the original author may also be in the Slack Channel, I was curious about the decision to use synchronous hashing.
