Here's some more information about me!

## Scripting Language of Choice: Javascript

The first programming languages I learned formally were Java and C++. When I started using Javascript back in 2016, I hated it for all the reasons you hear about: the use of `var`, prototypical inheritance, the lack of typing, how it tries to keep running where other languages would abort, the strange event loop, and callbacks, among other things. But after diving into it recently to write sorting algorithms, I began to love it â€” especially the recent changes in ES6. 

I don't know that there are many languages that care as much about continuing to improve the quality of life for developers as ECMAScript does. If something is annoying to write, there's probably syntatic sugar for it, or it's on the way, like top-level `await` and `Array.prototype.at()`, which allows you to index from the end of an array with negative numbers (as shows up in other languages), which were added in ECMAScript 2022! The language is a great success story, in my book, especially considering where it started.

Python and Ruby are both pretty neat too, and I enjoy using them. I feel that, with Python, you can feel the C underneath, and with Ruby, it's nice to use a language that seemed to ask "how should this be?" from a blank slate.

## Also, Typescript is amazing
what else can I say

## Technical Communication:

[Here are some examples of my technical communication in a professional setting, which is collectively every message I sent to my cohort at App Academy.](./technical-communication/README.md) I strongly believe that "soft" skills are as important as the "hard" skills of software engineering. Not only communication, but your personal impact on your team members. Are they energized by interacting with you? Does getting together generate excitement and confidence? I would call this "impact on atmosphere", and I think it's underrated.

## Technologies I've used:

loosely organized: 

| Front-End | Back-End | Database / ORM  | Tools | AWS |
| :---:     | :---:    |   :---:         |     :---:  | :-: |
|  React    |  Python  |  PostgresQL     |  Heroku    | S3 |
| Redux     | Flask    |  Sequelize       |  Docker    |  CloudFront  |
|Javascript | Express  |  SQLAlchemy      |           |  Route 53  |
|   HTML    | Node     |                  |           |    EC2  |
|   CSS     |  Ruby    |                  |           |  RDS   |


## Interests ie. the subjects of the books that are piled up on my nightstand:

- C
- C++    (I took a [course](https://cs-courses.mines.edu/csci261/syllabus.html) on it a long time ago at Mines, but I want to go deeper)
- Multiplayer Video Game Netcode Development â€” I think an FPS with thousands of concurrent players in one server is possible
- Assembly Languages
- Operating Systems
- Embedded Systems
- DevOps
